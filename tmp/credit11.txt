Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Advances to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until the Termination Date in an aggregate amount (based in respect of any Advances denominated in a Committed Currency on the Equivalent in Dollars \n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndetermined on the date of delivery of the applicable Notice of Borrowing) not to exceed at any time outstanding the Dollar amount set forth opposite such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s name on Schedule\xc2\xa02.01 or, if such Lender has become a Lender hereunder pursuant to an Assumption Agreement, the Dollar amount set forth for such Lender in such Assumption Agreement or, if such Lender has entered into an Assignment and Acceptance, the Dollar amount set forth for such Lender in the Register maintained by the Designated Agent pursuant to Section\xc2\xa09.07(c), as such amount may be reduced pursuant to Section\xc2\xa02.04 or increased pursuant to Section\xc2\xa02.19 (such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCommitment\xe2\x80\x9d), in any case and at any time less the amount of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Letter of Credit Exposure; provided that the Lenders shall not be obligated to, and shall not, make any Advances as part of a Borrowing if after giving effect to such Borrowing the sum of the then-outstanding aggregate amount of all Borrowings and the then outstanding aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liability shall exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments then in effect. Each Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000, \xc2\xa35,000,000, \xe2\x82\xac5,000,000 or \xc2\xa5500,000,000, as applicable, or an integral multiple of $1,000,000, \xc2\xa31,000,000, \xe2\x82\xac1,000,000 or \xc2\xa5100,000,000, as applicable, in excess thereof, except that any Borrowing may be in an amount equal to the remaining unused amount of the Commitments or the Equivalent thereof in a Committed Currency; provided that, in the case of any Borrowing made for the purpose of reimbursing a drawing under any Letter of Credit, (A) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing shall be not less than $1,000,000 and (B) if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than $5,000,000, such Borrowing shall consist solely of Base Rate Advances. Except as set forth in clause (B) of the preceding sentence, each Borrowing shall consist of Advances of the same Type made on the same day by the Lenders ratably according to their respective Commitments. Within the limits of each Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Commitment, the Borrower from time to time may borrow under this Section\xc2\xa02.01, prepay pursuant to Section\xc2\xa02.10 and reborrow under this Section\xc2\xa02.01. \n\nSECTION 2.02 Making the Advances. (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than (x) 11:00\xc2\xa0A.M. (New York City time) on the same Business Day as the date of a proposed Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Advances, (y) 11:00\xc2\xa0A.M. (London time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of a proposed Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in any Committed Currency or (z) 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of a proposed Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in Dollars, by the Borrower to the Designated Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier. Each such notice of a Borrowing (a \xe2\x80\x9cNotice of Borrowing\xe2\x80\x9d) shall be by telecopier, or by telephone confirmed immediately by telecopier, in substantially the form of Exhibit\xc2\xa0A-1 hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing and (iv) in the case of a Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, initial Interest Period and currency for each such Advance. Each Lender shall, before (A) 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing consisting of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) 1:00 P.M. (London time) on the date of such Borrowing consisting of Advances denominated in any Committed Currency, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Designated Agent at the Designated Agent\xe2\x80\x99s Account, in same day funds, such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s ratable portion of such Borrowing. After the Designated Agent\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article\xc2\xa0IV, the Designated Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower at the office where the Designated Agent\xe2\x80\x99s Account is maintained (or to an account of the Borrower in the relevant jurisdiction and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Notice of Borrowing, in the case of Advances denominated in a Committed Currency).\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing which the related Notice of Borrowing specifies as to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense \n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nincurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article\xc2\xa0IV, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Eurocurrency Rate Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Eurocurrency Rate Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.\n\n(c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unless the Designated Agent shall have received notice from a Lender on or prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Designated Agent such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Designated Agent may, but shall not be required to, assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Designated Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection\xc2\xa0(a) of this Section\xc2\xa02.02 and the Designated Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have made such ratable portion available to the Designated Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Designated Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is paid to the Designated Agent, at (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Designated Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies; provided, however, that (i) within two Business Days after any Lender shall fail to make such ratable portion available to the Designated Agent, the Designated Agent shall notify the Borrower of such failure and (ii) if such Lender shall not have paid such corresponding amount to the Designated Agent within two Business Days after such demand is made of such Lender by the Designated Agent, the Borrower agrees to repay to the Designated Agent forthwith upon demand by the Designated Agent to the Borrower such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Designated Agent, at the interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing. If and to the extent such corresponding amount shall be paid by such Lender to the Designated Agent in accordance with this Section\xc2\xa02.02(c), such amount shall constitute such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Advance as part of such Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement.\n\n(d)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.\n\nSECTION 2.03 Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Commitment (i) in the case of each Lender on the Effective Date, from the Effective Date or (ii) in the case of any Lender that becomes a Lender after the Effective Date, the effective date specified in the Assumption Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender, until, in each case, the Termination Date, payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of each January, April, July and October during the term of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Commitment, commencing April\xc2\xa02,\xc2\xa02018, and on the Termination Date, at the rate per annum equal to the Commitment Fee Percentage in effect from time to time.\n\nSECTION 2.04 Reduction of the Commitments. The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days\xe2\x80\x99 notice to the Designated Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portions of the respective Commitments of the Lenders; provided that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess \n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthereof; provided further that after giving effect to any such partial reduction, the total Commitments shall not be less than the sum of (i)\xc2\xa0then-outstanding aggregate amount of Advances and (ii)\xc2\xa0the Letter of Credit Liability. Once terminated, such Commitments may not be reinstated.\n\nSECTION 2.05 Repayment of Advances. The Borrower shall repay to each Lender on the Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender on such date.\n\nSECTION 2.06 Interest on Advances. (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Scheduled Interest. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to such Lender from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:\n\n(i)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (A)\xc2\xa0the Base Rate and (B)\xc2\xa0the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of each January, April, July and October during such periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.\n\n(ii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Eurocurrency Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (A) the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period for such Advance and (B) the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on the date which occurs three months and, if applicable, six months, nine months and twelve months after the first day of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurocurrency Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Default Interest. The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance that is not paid when due and on the unpaid amount of all interest, fees and other amounts payable hereunder that is not paid when due, payable on demand of the Designated Agent or the Majority Lenders, at a rate per annum equal at all times to (i) in the case of any amount of principal, 2.00% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior to the date on which such amount became due and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, in the case of all other amounts, 2.00% per annum above the rate of interest applicable to Base Rate Advances in effect from time to time.\n\nSECTION 2.07 [Intentionally Omitted.]\n\nSECTION 2.08 Interest Rate and Letter of Credit Determination. (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If requested, each Reference Bank may, but shall not be required to, furnish to the Designated Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each Eurocurrency Rate. If any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Designated Agent for the purpose of determining such interest rate, the Designated Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks.\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Designated Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of (i)\xc2\xa0the applicable interest rate and/or letter of credit fee determined by the Designated Agent and (ii)\xc2\xa0subject to Section 2.13(b), the details of such determination (including, without limitation, disclosure of the Credit Default Swap Spread) for purposes of Sections 2.06(a)(i), 2.06(a)(ii) and/or 3.05(a).\n\n(c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If at any time when the Eurocurrency Rate is being determined by reference to rates furnished by the Reference Banks in accordance with the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cEurocurrency Rate\xe2\x80\x9d, fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely information to the Designated Agent for purposes of \n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndetermining the Eurocurrency Rate for any Eurocurrency Rate Advances, (i) the Designated Agent shall forthwith notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such Eurocurrency Rate Advances, (ii) each such Advance denominated in Dollars will automatically, on the last day of the then-existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance (or, if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), (iii) each such Advance denominated in a currency other than Dollars shall be prepaid and (iv) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Designated Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.\n\n(d)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Advances in any currency, (i) the Designated Agent shall be unable to determine the Eurocurrency Rate as contemplated hereby or (ii) the Majority Lenders notify the Designated Agent that (A)\xc2\xa0they are unable to obtain matching deposits in such currency in the London interbank market at or about 11:00\xc2\xa0A.M. (London time) on the second Business Day before the making of a Borrowing (or, in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Sterling, on the date of such Borrowing) in sufficient amounts to fund their respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances as a part of such Borrowing during its Interest Period or (B)\xc2\xa0the Eurocurrency Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders (which cost each such Majority Lender reasonably determines in good faith is material) of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances in such currency for such Interest Period, the Designated Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon, unless, in the case of a development referred to in the preceding clause (ii)(B), the Applicable Margin shall be increased to reflect such costs as determined by such Majority Lenders and as agreed by the Borrower, and in any event subject to clause (e) below, (A)\xc2\xa0the obligation of the Lenders to make or continue at the end of the Interest Period, or to Convert Base Rate Advances into, Eurocurrency Rate Advances in such currency shall be suspended until the Designated Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and (B)\xc2\xa0the Borrower will, on the last day of the then-existing Interest Period therefor, (1)\xc2\xa0if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars, either (x) prepay such Advances or (y) Convert such Advances into Base Rate Advances and (2)\xc2\xa0if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in any affected Committed Currency,\xc2\xa0prepay such Advances. The Designated Agent shall use reasonable efforts to determine from time to time whether the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and, promptly after the Designated Agent knows that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, the Designated Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders.\n\n(e)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If at any time the Designated Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i)\xc2\xa0the circumstances set forth in clause (d)(i)\xc2\xa0have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances set forth in clause (d)(i)\xc2\xa0have not arisen but the supervisor for the administrator of the Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Designated Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the Screen Rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Designated Agent and the Borrower shall endeavor to establish an alternate rate of interest to the Eurocurrency Rate that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable (but for the avoidance of doubt, such related changes shall not include a reduction of the Applicable Margin). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.01, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Designated Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date notice of such alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Majority Lenders stating that such \n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajority Lenders object to such amendment. Until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this clause (e) (but, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this clause (e), only to the extent the Screen Rate for the applicable currency and such Interest Period is not available or published at such time on a current basis), clauses (A) and (B) of clause (d) shall be applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any alternate rate of interest established pursuant to this clause (e) (without giving effect to the Applicable Margin or any alternative spread that may have been agreed upon over the applicable Lenders\xe2\x80\x99 deemed cost of funds) shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for all purposes of this Agreement.\n\n(f)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cInterest Period\xe2\x80\x9d in Section 1.01, the Designated Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then-existing Interest Period therefor, (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars, be Converted into Base Rate Advances and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in any Committed Currency, be continued as Eurocurrency Rate Advances with a one-month Interest Period.\n\n(g)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default under Section\xc2\xa07.01(a), (i)\xc2\xa0each Eurocurrency Rate Advance denominated in Dollars will automatically, on the last day of the then-existing Interest Period therefor,\xc2\xa0be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii)\xc2\xa0the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended.\n\nSECTION 2.09 Optional Conversion of Advances. The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Designated Agent not later than (i)\xc2\xa011:00\xc2\xa0A.M. (New York City time) on the same Business Day as the date of the proposed Conversion in the case of a Conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances and (ii) 1:00 P.M. (London time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion in the case of a Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Eurocurrency Rate Advances or of Eurocurrency Rate Advances of one Interest Period into Eurocurrency Rate Advances of another Interest Period, as the case may be, and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08 and 2.12, Convert all Advances denominated in Dollars of one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Advances denominated in Dollars of the other Type; provided, however, that any Conversion of any Eurocurrency Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances or into Eurocurrency Rate Advances of another Interest Period shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Advances. Promptly upon receipt from the Borrower of a notice of a proposed Conversion hereunder, the Designated Agent shall give notice of such proposed Conversion to each Lender. Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions set forth above, specify (x)\xc2\xa0the date of such Conversion (which shall be a Business Day), (y) the Advances to be Converted and (z) if such Conversion is into Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such Advance. The Borrower may Convert all Eurocurrency Rate Advances of any one Lender into Base Rate Advances of such Lender in accordance with the provisions of Section\xc2\xa02.12 by complying with the procedures set forth therein and in this Section\xc2\xa02.09 as though each reference in this Section\xc2\xa02.09 to Advances denominated in Dollars of any Type were to such Advances of such Lender. Each such notice of Conversion shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08 and 2.12, be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.\n\nSECTION 2.10 Prepayments of Advances. (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Optional. The Borrower may, upon not less than (i) the same Business Day\xe2\x80\x99s notice to the Designated Agent received not later than 11:00\xc2\xa0A.M. (New York City time) in the case of Borrowings consisting of Base Rate Advances, (ii) three Business Days\xe2\x80\x99 notice to the Designated Agent received not later than 11:00\xc2\xa0A.M. (New York City time) in the case of Borrowings consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in any Committed Currency, or (iii) three Business Days\xe2\x80\x99 notice to the Designated Agent received not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York \n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity time) in the case of Borrowings consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in Dollars, stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Advances constituting part of the same Borrowings in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the Equivalent thereof in a Committed Currency determined on the date notice of prepayment is given) and (y) in the case of any such prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section\xc2\xa09.04(b).\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mandatory. (i)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the Designated Agent provides a written notice in conformity with Section 2.10(b)(ii) to the Borrower that, on any date, the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances and Letter of Credit Liabilities denominated in Dollars then outstanding and (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior to such date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Advances and Letter of Credit Liabilities denominated in Committed Currencies then outstanding exceeds 102% of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders on such date, the Borrower shall, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, prepay the outstanding principal amount of any Advances, and/or to the extent necessary, deposit into the LC Collateral Account in Dollars, an amount (which amount shall be held by the Designated Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, as cash collateral for the Borrower\xe2\x80\x99s obligations with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit) necessary so that, after giving effect to such prepayment of Advances and such deposit, the sum of (A) and (B) above less the amount to be deposited in the LC Collateral Account does not exceed 100% of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders on such date as set forth in the written notice from the Designated Agent to the Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof. Any such amounts so deposited with the Designated Agent as cash collateral in the LC Collateral Account shall (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) be released to the Borrower on the date on which the sum of (A) and (B) above does not exceed 100% of the sum of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders and the amount on deposit in the LC Collateral Account (after giving effect to any proposed release) on such date. In connection therewith, upon the request of the Designated Agent the Borrower shall, to the extent the LC Collateral Account has not theretofore been opened, open the LC Collateral Account with the Designated Agent and enter into such documents relating thereto as are reasonably requested by the Designated Agent and mutually acceptable between the Borrower and the Designated Agent.\n\n(ii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each prepayment made pursuant to this Section\xc2\xa02.10(b) shall be made together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the principal amounts prepaid and, in the case of any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period, with any additional amounts which the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse to the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section\xc2\xa09.04(b). The Designated Agent shall give prompt written notice of any prepayment required under this Section\xc2\xa02.10(b) to the Borrower and the Lenders and such notice shall specify the amount of such prepayment and contain a reasonably detailed calculation thereof.\n\nSECTION 2.11 Increased Costs.

Each determination by the Designated Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes hereof, absent manifest error (it being understood and agreed that, with respect to any Reference Bank, nothing in this Agreement shall require the Designated Agent to disclose to any other party hereto (other than the Borrower) any information regarding such Reference Bank or any rate provided by such Reference Bank in accordance with the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cEurocurrency \n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate\xe2\x80\x9d, including, without limitation, whether such Reference Bank has provided a rate or the rate provided by any such Reference Bank).\n\n(c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes, if any, shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of the payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.\n\n(d)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unless the Designated Agent or the respective Issuing Bank shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Designated Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Designated Agent or the respective Issuing Bank on such date and the Designated Agent or the respective Issuing Bank may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section\xc2\xa02.14(i) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section\xc2\xa02.14(i), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section\xc2\xa02.14(i) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.\n\n(j)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section\xc2\xa02.14 shall survive the payment in full of the principal and interest on all Advances and the termination of this Agreement until such date as all applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions thereof) have expired with respect to such agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section\xc2\xa02.14.\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 2.15 Sharing of Payments, etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or otherwise) on account of (i) the Advances made by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.11, 2.14, 9.04 or 9.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lenders or (ii) any Letter of Credit Liability of the Borrower hereunder (other than pursuant to Section 2.11, 2.14, 9.04 or 9.08) in excess of its LC Commitment Percentage of any such payments on account of such Letter of Credit Liability obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances made by them or the participations purchased pursuant to Section 3.04 as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery, together with an amount equal to such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.\n\nSECTION 2.16 Mandatory Assignment by a Lender; Mitigation. If any Lender (which term shall include any Issuing Bank for purposes of this Section 2.16) (a)\xc2\xa0requests from the Borrower either reimbursement for increased costs pursuant to Section 2.11, or payment of or reimbursement for Taxes pursuant to Section 2.14, or if any Lender notifies the Designated Agent that it is unlawful for such Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder pursuant to Section\xc2\xa02.12, (b) has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver or consent that under Section\xc2\xa09.01 requires the consent of all the Lenders (or all the affected Lenders) and with respect to which the Majority Lenders shall have granted their consent or (c) is a Defaulting Lender, (i) in the case of clause (a), such Lender will, upon three Business Days\xe2\x80\x99 notice by the Borrower to such Lender and the Designated Agent, to the extent not inconsistent with such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s internal policies and applicable legal and regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts to make, fund or maintain its Eurocurrency Rate Advances or Letters of Credit through another office of such Lender if (A) as a result thereof, the additional amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.14, as applicable, in respect of such Eurocurrency Rate Advances or Letters of Credit would be materially reduced or the provisions of Section 2.12 would not apply to such Lender, as applicable, and (B) as determined by such Lender in good faith but in its sole discretion, the making or maintaining of such Eurocurrency Rate Advances or Letters of Credit through such other office would not otherwise materially and adversely affect such Eurocurrency Rate Advances or Letters of Credit or such Lender and (ii) in case of clauses (a), (b) and (c), unless such Lender has theretofore taken steps to remove or cure, and has removed or cured, the conditions creating such obligation to pay such additional amounts or the circumstances described in Section 2.12 or has consented to the amendment, waiver or consent specified in clause (b), or is no longer a Defaulting Lender (other than if it became a Defaulting Lender due to a Bail-In Action, in which case such Borrower\xe2\x80\x99s right shall continue notwithstanding), the Borrower may designate an Eligible Assignee to purchase for cash (pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance) all, but not less than all, of the Advances and unreimbursed funded participations in Letters of Credit then owing to such Lender and to acquire and assume all, but not less than all, of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s rights and obligations hereunder, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Lender, for a purchase price equal to the outstanding principal amount of each such Advance then owing to such Lender plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any accrued but unpaid fees owing thereto and, in addition, (A) all additional cost reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities, if any, owing in respect of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Commitment hereunder, and all other accrued and unpaid \n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\namounts owing to such Lender hereunder, at such time shall be paid to such Lender and (B) if such Eligible Assignee is not otherwise a Lender at such time, any applicable processing and recordation fee under Section\xc2\xa09.07(a) for such assignment shall have been paid; provided that, in the case of any assignment resulting from the circumstances specified in clause (b), the Eligible Assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent and, as a result of such assignment and any contemporaneous assignments, the applicable amendment, waiver or consent can be effected.\n\nSECTION 2.17 Evidence of Debt. (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Designated Agent) to the effect that a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and such Lender (each, a \xe2\x80\x9cNote\xe2\x80\x9d), payable to such Lender in a principal amount equal to the Commitment of such Lender; provided, however, that the execution and delivery of such promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness shall not be a condition precedent to the making of any Advance under this Agreement.\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Register maintained by the Designated Agent pursuant to Section\xc2\xa09.07(c) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances and currencies comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assumption Agreement and each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by the Designated Agent, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Designated Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender\xe2\x80\x99s share thereof.\n\n(c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Entries made in good faith by the Designated Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection\xc2\xa0(b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection\xc2\xa0(a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the Designated Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 2.18 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances shall be available and Letters of Credit shall be Issued (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds and such Letters of Credit) for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section\xc2\xa02.18, the Borrower will not use the proceeds of any Advance to purchase the capital stock of any corporation in a transaction, or as part of a series of transactions, (i) the purpose of which is, at the time of any such purchase, to acquire control of such corporation or (ii) the result of which is the ownership by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of 10% or more of the capital stock of such corporation, in either case if the board of directors of such corporation has publicly announced its opposition to such transaction.\n\nSECTION 2.19 Increase in the Aggregate Commitments. (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Borrower may, at any time, by notice to the Designated Agent, request that the aggregate amount of the Commitments be increased by an amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof (each, a \n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommitment Increase\xe2\x80\x9d) to be effective as of a date that is at least 90 days prior to the scheduled Termination Date then in effect (the \xe2\x80\x9cIncrease Date\xe2\x80\x9d) as specified in the related notice to the Designated Agent; provided, however, that (i) in no event shall the sum of the aggregate amount of the Commitments hereunder and the aggregate amount of the commitments under the 2016 Credit Agreement, or any agreement extending or replacing such 2016 Credit Agreement, at any time exceed $7,250,000,000, (ii) no Event of Default, or event that with the giving of notice or passage of time or both would constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing as of the date of such request or as of the applicable Increase Date, or would occur as a result thereof and (iii)\xc2\xa0the representations and warranties contained in Section\xc2\xa05.02 shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such Increase Date, before and after giving effect to such increase.\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Designated Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of a request by the Borrower for a Commitment Increase, which notice shall include (i)\xc2\xa0the proposed amount of such requested Commitment Increase, (ii)\xc2\xa0the proposed Increase Date and (iii)\xc2\xa0the date by which Lenders wishing to participate in the Commitment Increase must commit to an increase in the amount of their respective Commitments (the \xe2\x80\x9cCommitment Date\xe2\x80\x9d). Each Lender that is willing to participate in such requested Commitment Increase (each, an \xe2\x80\x9cIncreasing Lender\xe2\x80\x9d) shall give written notice to the Designated Agent on or prior to the Commitment Date of the amount by which it is willing to increase its Commitment. If the Lenders notify the Designated Agent that they are willing to increase the amount of their respective Commitments by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the requested Commitment Increase, the requested Commitment Increase shall be allocated among the Lenders willing to participate therein in such amounts as are agreed between the Borrower and the Designated Agent. The failure of any Lender to respond shall be deemed to be a refusal of such Lender to increase its Commitment.\n\n(c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Promptly following each Commitment Date, the Designated Agent shall notify the Borrower as to the amount, if any, by which the Lenders are willing to participate in the requested Commitment Increase. If the aggregate amount by which the Lenders are willing to participate in any requested Commitment Increase on any such Commitment Date is less than the requested Commitment Increase, then the Borrower may extend offers to one or more Eligible Assignees to participate in any portion of the requested Commitment Increase that has not been committed to by the Lenders as of the applicable Commitment Date; provided, however, that the Commitment of each such Eligible Assignee shall be in an amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.\n\n(d)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On each Increase Date, each Eligible Assignee that accepts an offer to participate in a requested Commitment Increase in accordance with Section\xc2\xa02.19(c) shall become a Lender party to this Agreement as of such Increase Date and the Commitment of each Increasing Lender for such requested Commitment Increase shall be increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such Lender pursuant to the last sentence of Section\xc2\xa02.19(b)) as of such Increase Date; provided, however, that the Designated Agent shall have received on or before such Increase Date the following, each dated such date:\n\n(i)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(A)\xc2\xa0certified copies of resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Borrower or the Executive Committee of such Board approving the Commitment Increase and the corresponding modifications to this Agreement (unless such increase and corresponding modifications shall have been authorized by resolutions previously delivered to the Designated Agent hereunder) and (B)\xc2\xa0an opinion of counsel for the Borrower (which may be in-house counsel) in form and substance satisfactory to the Designated Agent;\n\n(ii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0an Assumption Agreement, duly executed by such Assuming Lender, the Designated Agent and the Borrower; and\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0confirmation from each Increasing Lender of the increase in the amount of its Commitment in a writing satisfactory to the Borrower and the Designated Agent.\n\n(e)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On each Increase Date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Section\xc2\xa02.19(d), the Designated Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) and the Borrower, on or before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time), by telecopier, of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase to be effected on such Increase Date and shall record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender on such date.\n\nSECTION 2.20 Extension of Termination Date. (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At least 45 days but not more than 75 days prior to any Anniversary Date, the Borrower, by written notice to the Designated Agent, may request an extension of the Termination Date in effect at such time by one calendar year from its then scheduled date; provided, however, that if the Borrower does not request an extension of the Termination Date in a timely manner prior to any Anniversary Date it may, but shall not be obligated to, request that the Termination Date be extended for two consecutive calendar years from its then scheduled date by making a request therefor in a timely manner prior to the next succeeding Anniversary Date. The Designated Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request, and each Lender shall in turn, in its sole discretion, not later than 30 days prior to such next Anniversary Date, notify the Borrower and the Designated Agent in writing as to whether such Lender will consent to such extension. If any Lender shall fail to notify the Designated Agent and the Borrower in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the Termination Date at least 30 days prior to the next Anniversary Date, such Lender shall be deemed to be a Declining Lender with respect to such request. The Designated Agent shall notify the Borrower not later than 25\xc2\xa0days prior to such next Anniversary Date of the decision of the Lenders regarding the Borrower\xe2\x80\x99s request for an extension of the Termination Date.\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If all of the Lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection\xc2\xa0(a) of this Section\xc2\xa02.20, the Termination Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at such next Anniversary Date (the \xe2\x80\x9cExtension Date\xe2\x80\x9d), be extended for one calendar year or two calendar years, as properly requested; provided that (i) on such Extension Date, no Event of Default, or event that with the giving of notice or passage of time or both would constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing, or would occur as a consequence thereof, and (ii) the representations and warranties contained in Section\xc2\xa05.02 shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such Extension Date, before and after giving effect to the extension of the Termination Date. If fewer than all of the Lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection\xc2\xa0(a) of this Section\xc2\xa02.20, the Termination Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable Extension Date, be extended as to those Lenders that so consented (each, an \xe2\x80\x9cExtending Lender\xe2\x80\x9d) but shall not be extended as to any other Lender (each, a \xe2\x80\x9cDeclining Lender\xe2\x80\x9d). To the extent that the Termination Date is not extended as to any Lender pursuant to this Section\xc2\xa02.20 and the Commitment of such Lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection\xc2\xa0(c) of this Section\xc2\xa02.20 on or prior to the applicable Extension Date, the Commitment of such Declining Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended Termination Date without any further notice or other action by the Borrower, such Lender or any other Person and any outstanding Advances due to such Declining Lender shall be paid in full on such unextended Termination Date (and on such unextended Termination Date the Borrower shall also make such other prepayments of Advances as shall be required in order that, after giving effect thereto and to the termination of the Commitments of, and all payments to, the Declining Lenders pursuant to this sentence, the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances and Letter of Credit Liabilities denominated in Dollars then outstanding and (B) the Equivalent in Dollars of the aggregate principal amount of all Advances and Letter of Credit Liabilities denominated in Committed Currencies then outstanding will not exceed the aggregate Commitments); provided that such Declining Lender\xe2\x80\x99s rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14, 9.04 and 9.08, and its obligations under Section\xc2\xa08.05, shall survive the \n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTermination Date for such Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date. It is understood and agreed that no Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the Borrower for any requested extension of the Termination Date.\n\n(c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If there are any Declining Lenders, the Borrower may arrange for one or more Extending Lenders or other Eligible Assignees that will agree to an extension of the Termination Date to assume, effective as of the Extension Date, any Declining Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Commitment and all of the obligations of such Declining Lender under this Agreement thereafter arising, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Declining Lender; provided, however, that the amount of the Commitment of any such Assuming Lender as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $25,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Declining Lender is less than $25,000,000, in which case such Assuming Lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; provided further that:\n\n(i)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0any such Extending Lender or Assuming Lender shall have paid to such Declining Lender (A) the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding Advances, if any, of such Declining Lender plus (B) any accrued but unpaid fees owing to such Declining Lender as of the effective date of such assignment;\n\n(ii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0all additional cost reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Declining Lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Declining Lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such Declining Lender; and\n\n(iii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0with respect to any such Assuming Lender, any applicable processing and recordation fee required under Section\xc2\xa09.07(a) for such assignment shall have been paid;\n\nprovided further that such Declining Lender\xe2\x80\x99s rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14, 9.04 and 9.08, and its obligations under Section\xc2\xa08.05, shall survive such substitution as to matters occurring prior to the date of substitution. At least three Business Days prior to the applicable Extension Date, (A) each Assuming Lender, if any, shall have delivered to the Borrower and the Designated Agent an assumption agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Borrower and the Designated Agent (an \xe2\x80\x9cAssumption Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d), duly executed by such Assuming Lender, such Declining Lender, the Borrower and the Designated Agent and (B) any such Extending Lender shall have delivered confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Borrower and the Designated Agent as to the increase in the amount of its Commitment. Each Declining Lender being replaced pursuant to this Section\xc2\xa02.20 shall deliver to the Designated Agent on or before the applicable Extension Date any Note or Notes held by such Declining Lender. Upon the payment or prepayment of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, each such Extending Lender or Assuming Lender, as of the Extension Date, will be substituted for such Declining Lender under this Agreement and shall be a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement, without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other Lenders, and the obligations of each such Declining Lender hereunder shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged.\n\n(d)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If all of the Extending Lenders and Assuming Lenders (after giving effect to any assignments and assumptions pursuant to subsection\xc2\xa0(c) of this Section\xc2\xa02.20) consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by written consent pursuant to subsection\xc2\xa0(a) of this Section\xc2\xa02.20, by execution and delivery of an Assumption Agreement or otherwise) not later than one Business Day prior to such Extension Date, the Designated Agent shall so notify the Borrower, and, so long as (i) no Event of Default, or event that with the giving of notice or passage of time or both would constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing as of such Extension Date, or would occur as a \n\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsequence thereof and (ii)\xc2\xa0the representations and warranties contained in Section\xc2\xa05.02 shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such Extension Date, before and after giving effect to the extension of the Termination Date, the Termination Date then in effect shall be extended for the additional one-year period or two-year period, as the case may be, as described in subsection\xc2\xa0(a) of this Section\xc2\xa02.20, and all references in this Agreement, and in the Notes, if any, to the \xe2\x80\x9cTermination Date\xe2\x80\x9d shall, with respect to each Extending Lender and each Assuming Lender for such Extension Date, refer to the Termination Date as so extended. Promptly following each Extension Date, the Designated Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) of the extension of the scheduled Termination Date in effect immediately prior thereto and shall thereupon record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each such Extending Lender and each such Assuming Lender.\n\nSECTION 2.21 Defaulting Lenders. (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if one or more Lenders become Defaulting Lenders, then, upon notice to such effect by the Designated Agent (which notice shall be given promptly after the Designated Agent becomes aware that any Lender shall have become a Defaulting Lender, including as a result of being advised thereof by the Borrower) (such notice being referred to as a \xe2\x80\x9cDefaulting Lender Notice\xe2\x80\x9d), the following provisions shall apply for so long as any such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:\n\n(i)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0no commitment fee shall accrue or at any time be payable for such period on the unused amount of the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section\xc2\xa02.03(a);

Promptly after receiving such reports, the Designated Agent shall forward copies thereof to the Borrower.\n\n(d)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the Borrower so requests, an Issuing Bank shall issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (an \xe2\x80\x9cAuto-Renewal Letter of Credit\xe2\x80\x9d); provided, that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must permit the respective Issuing Bank to prevent any such renewal at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with its date of Issuance) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the \xe2\x80\x9cNon-Renewal Notice Date\xe2\x80\x9d) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the respective Issuing Bank to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time, provided, however, that, in no event shall an Issuing Bank permit any such renewal if such Issuing Bank has received notice on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Renewal Notice Date from the Designated Agent that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section\xc2\xa04.02 is not then satisfied. Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this Section\xc2\xa03.01(d) shall limit the ability of the respective Issuing Bank to exercise any of its rights with respect to any Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n(e)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each Issuing Bank shall notify the Designated Agent in writing upon the reduction or termination of any Letter of Credit Issued by it within two Business Days after any such reduction or termination.\n\n(f)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Within the limits of the obligations of the Issuing Banks set forth above and in Section\xc2\xa03.02, the Borrower may request the Issuing Banks to Issue one or more Letters of Credit, reimburse the Issuing Banks for payments made thereunder pursuant to Section\xc2\xa03.04(a) and request the Issuing Banks to Issue one or more additional Letters of Credit under this Section\xc2\xa03.01.\n\nSECTION 3.02 Issuing the Letters of Credit.

With respect to its Commitment and the Advances made by it and any Note or Notes issued to it, the Designated Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Designated Agent; and the term \xe2\x80\x9cLender\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cLenders\xe2\x80\x9d shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include the Designated Agent in its individual capacity.

Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse such Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by such Issuing Bank in connection with the preparation, execution, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or the Letters of Credit Issued by it, to the extent that the Issuing Bank is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs expenses or disbursements, this Section 8.05(b) applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Designated Agent, any Issuing Bank any Lender or a third party.\n\nSECTION 8.06 Successor Designated Agent.

If no successor Designated Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Designated Agent\xe2\x80\x99s giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Designated Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a \n\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuccessor Designated Agent.

After any retiring Designated Agent\xe2\x80\x99s resignation hereunder as Designated Agent, the provisions of this Article\xc2\xa0VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Designated Agent under this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 8.07 Certain Lender Representations, Etc. \n\n(a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each Lender represents and warrants, as

Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Designated Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. \n\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.\n\nSECTION 9.06 Binding Effect.

Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights (other than any rights such Lender assignor may have under Sections\xc2\xa02.11, 2.14 and 9.08) and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the \n\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nremaining portion of an assigning Lender\xe2\x80\x99s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section\xc2\xa05.01(c), and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Designated Agent, any Issuing Bank, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Designated Agent or the respective Issuing Bank to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Designated Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.\n\n(c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Designated Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance and each Assumption Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the \xe2\x80\x9cRegister\xe2\x80\x9d). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Designated Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice to the Designated Agent.\n\n(d)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee and, if applicable, the Borrower, together with any Note subject to such assignment, the Designated Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and each Issuing Bank.\n\n(e)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment and the Advances owing to it and any Note issued to it hereunder); provided, however, that (i) such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrower, the Designated Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s rights and obligations under this Agreement and (iv) such Lender shall not agree in any participation agreement with any participant or proposed participant to obtain the consent of such participant before agreeing to the amendment, modification or waiver of any of the terms of this \n\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreement or any Note before consenting to any action or failure to act by the Borrower or any other party hereunder or under any Note, or before exercising any rights it may have in respect thereof, unless such amendment, modification, waiver, consent or exercise would (A) increase the amount of such participant\xe2\x80\x99s portion of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Commitment, (B) reduce the principal amount of or rate of interest on the Advances, any amount due hereunder with respect to the Letters of Credit or any fee or other amounts payable hereunder to which such participant would be entitled to receive a share under such participation agreement, or (C) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on the Advances, for amounts due with respect to Letters of Credit or any fee or other amounts payable hereunder to which such participant would be entitled to receive a share under such participation agreement. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the Advances or other obligations under this Agreement (the \xe2\x80\x9cParticipant Register\xe2\x80\x9d); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a participant\xe2\x80\x99s interest in any Commitments, Advances, Notes or its other obligations under this Agreement) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is requested by such Person and is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Advance, Note or other obligation is in registered form under Section\xc2\xa05f.103-1(c) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Designated Agent (in its capacity as Designated Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.\n\n(f)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section\xc2\xa09.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in writing and directly related to the transactions contemplated hereunder; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the Borrower received by it from such Lender in accordance with the terms of Section\xc2\xa09.09(a).\n\n(g)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No participation or assignment hereunder shall be made in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended from time to time, or any applicable state securities laws, and each Lender hereby represents that it will make any Advance for its own account in the ordinary course of its business and not with a view to the public distribution or sale thereof.\n\n(h)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, any Lender may at any time assign or create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances owing to it and any Note issued to it hereunder) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank or any foreign central bank having authority over such Lender in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor regulation thereto), any applicable operating circular of such Federal Reserve Bank or any other regulation issued by the applicable foreign central bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.\n\nSECTION 9.08 Indemnification. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Designated Agent, each Lender, each Issuing Bank and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an \xe2\x80\x9cIndemnified Party\xe2\x80\x9d) from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted against any Indemnified Party, in each case \n\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\narising out of or in connection with or by reason of, or in connection with the preparation for a defense of, any investigation, litigation or proceeding (whether or not an Indemnified Party is a party thereto) arising out of, related to or in connection with the Commitments hereunder or the Advances or Letter of Credit Issuances made pursuant hereto or any transactions in connection herewith, including, without limitation, any transaction in which any proceeds of the Advances or any Letter of Credit Issuance are, or are proposed to be, applied, or any action or proceeding relating to a court order, injunction or other process or decree restraining or seeking to restrain any Issuing Bank from paying any amount under any Letter of Credit (collectively, the \xe2\x80\x9cIndemnified Matters\xe2\x80\x9d); provided that the Borrower shall have no obligation to any Indemnified Party under this Section\xc2\xa09.08 with respect to (i) matters for which such Indemnified Party has been reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement, but only to the extent of such reimbursement, or (ii) Indemnified Matters found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnified Party. If any action is brought against any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Borrower in writing of the institution of such action and the Borrower shall thereupon have the right, at its option, to elect to assume the defense of such action; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not, in assuming the defense of any Indemnified Party in any Indemnified Matter, agree to any dismissal or settlement of such Indemnified Matter without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, if such dismissal or settlement (A) would require any admission or acknowledgment of culpability or wrongdoing by such Indemnified Party or (B) would provide for any non-monetary relief to any Person to be performed by such Indemnified Party. If the Borrower so elects, it shall promptly assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel (reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party) and payment of expenses. Such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (1) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the Borrower in connection with the defense of such action or (2) the Borrower shall not have properly employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to have charge of the defense of such action, in which case such fees and expenses shall be paid by the Borrower. If an Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded (based upon the advice of counsel) that the representation by one counsel of such Indemnified Party and the Borrower creates a conflict of interest for such counsel, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Borrower and the Borrower shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party (but shall retain the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the Borrower). Anything in this Section\xc2\xa09.08 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for any Indemnified Party in any jurisdiction as to any Indemnified Matter or for any settlement of any Indemnified Matter effected without its written consent. All obligations of the Borrower under this Section\xc2\xa09.08 shall survive the making and repayment of the Advances and the termination of this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 9.09 Confidentiality. \n\n(a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of the Designated Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Banks may disclose to any Person any confidential, proprietary or non-public information of the Borrower furnished to the Designated Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Banks by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (such information being referred to collectively herein as the \xe2\x80\x9cBorrower Information\xe2\x80\x9d), except that each of the Designated Agent, each of the Lenders and each of the Issuing Banks may disclose Borrower Information (i) to its and its Affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 employees, officers, directors, agents, auditors and advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Borrower Information and instructed to keep such Borrower Information confidential on substantially the same terms as provided herein), (ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority or self-regulatory body, (iii) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or \n\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsimilar legal process, (iv) to any other party to this Agreement, (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section\xc2\xa09.09(a), to any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (vii) to the extent such Borrower Information (A) is or becomes generally available to the public on a non-confidential basis, other than as a result of a breach of this Section\xc2\xa09.09(a) by the Designated Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, or (B) is or becomes available to the Designated Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower, its Affiliates or their respective officers, directors, agents, auditors and advisors, provided such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement or other legal or fiduciary obligations of secrecy with the Borrower or its Affiliates with respect to the Borrower Information and (viii)\xc2\xa0with the consent of the Borrower.\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Borrower agrees to maintain the confidentiality of any rate provided by an individual Reference Bank hereunder for purposes of setting the Eurocurrency Rate (and the name of such Reference Bank), except (i)\xc2\xa0to its and its Affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 employees, officers, directors, agents, auditors and advisors (it being understood that the persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and instructed to keep such information confidential on substantially the same terms as provided herein), (ii)\xc2\xa0as consented to by the applicable Reference Bank, (iii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority or self-regulatory body, (iv) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (v)\xc2\xa0in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder or (vi) to the extent such rate (A) is or becomes generally available to the public on a non-confidential basis, other than as a result of a breach of this Section\xc2\xa09.09(b) by the Borrower, or (B) is or becomes available to the Borrower on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the applicable Reference Bank, provided, to its knowledge, such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement or other legal or fiduciary obligations of secrecy with such Reference Bank with respect to the rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that the Borrower may disclose to any Lender the average of the rates quoted by the Reference Banks that provide rate quotes in connection with any determination of the Eurocurrency Rate.\n\nSECTION 9.10 Patriot Act. Each Lender and the Designated Agent hereby notifies the Borrower that, pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow it to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Borrower shall promptly provide such information upon request by any Lender or the Designated Agent.\n\nSECTION 9.11 Judgment. (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Designated Agent could purchase Dollars with such other currency at the Designated Agent\xe2\x80\x99s principal office in London at 11:00\xc2\xa0A.M. (London time) on the Business Day preceding that on which a final judgment is given.\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in a Committed Currency into Dollars, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Designated Agent could purchase such Committed Currency with Dollars \n\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat the Designated Agent\xe2\x80\x99s principal office in London at 11:00\xc2\xa0A.M.
