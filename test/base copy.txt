If such notice is given by a Borrower, such Borrower shall make such prepayment, and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable, on the date specified in the applicable notice; provided that if such notice is given in connection with a full or partial refinancing of the Commitments, such notice may condition the prepayment upon the effectiveness of such refinancing Indebtedness, in which case such notice may be revoked by such Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of such prepayment) if such condition is not satisfied. Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section\xc2\xa03.05. Subject to Section\xc2\xa02.13, each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. \n\n(b) If the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers at any time that (i)\xc2\xa0solely as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the Total Outstandings at such time exceed an amount equal to 105% of the Aggregate Commitments then in effect or (ii)\xc2\xa0other than as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the Total Outstandings at such time exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, then, in either case, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall prepay Loans in an aggregate amount at least equal to such excess. \n\n(c) If the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers at any time that (i)\xc2\xa0solely as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the Outstanding Amount of all Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies at such time exceeds an amount equal to 105% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect or (ii)\xc2\xa0other than as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the Outstanding Amount of all Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies at such time exceeds the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect, then, in either case, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall prepay Loans in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such Outstanding Amount as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n23 \n\n\n\n2.04 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Company may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i)\xc2\xa0any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), (ii)\xc2\xa0any such partial reduction shall be (unless the Aggregate Commitments are less than such amount) a whole multiple of $1,000,000, (iii)\xc2\xa0the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (iv)\xc2\xa0if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, the Alternative Currency Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Commitments, such Alternative Currency Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. The amount of any such Aggregate Commitment reduction shall not be applied to the Alternative Currency Sublimit unless otherwise specified by the Company. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage. All fees accrued pursuant to Section\xc2\xa02.07(a) until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. \n\n2.05 Repayment of Loans. Each Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Loans made to such Borrower and outstanding on such date. \n\n2.06 Interest. \n\n(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b)\xc2\xa0below, (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; and (ii)\xc2\xa0each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing or conversion date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. \n\n(b) If any amount payable by any Loan Party under any Loan Document is not paid when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then such overdue amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. \n\n(c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law. \n\n2.07 Fees. \n\n(a) Commitment Fee. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a commitment fee in Dollars equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Commitments exceed the sum of the Outstanding Amount of Loans, subject to adjustment as provided in Section\xc2\xa02.13. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n24 \n\n\n\nthe conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. \n\n(b) Other Fees. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account, in Dollars, fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. \n\n2.08 Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed (including the first day, but excluding the last day). All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (including the first day, but excluding the last day) (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year), or, in the case of interest in respect of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section\xc2\xa02.10(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. With respect to all Non-LIBOR Quoted Currencies, the calculation of the applicable interest rate shall be determined in accordance with market practice. \n\n2.09 Evidence of Debt. The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to a Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, such Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Loans to such Borrower in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to a Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. \n\n2.10 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent\xe2\x80\x99s Clawback. \n\n(a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent\xe2\x80\x99s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 4:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n25 \n\n\n\nAgent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent\xe2\x80\x99s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that it is required to do so for legal, operational or regulatory reasons, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a payment shall be treated as made in the United States if a wire transfer is made through a bank located in the United States at the direction of a Borrower. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i)\xc2\xa0after 4:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii)\xc2\xa0after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. \n\n(b)\xc2\xa0(i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section\xc2\xa02.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section\xc2\xa02.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A)\xc2\xa0in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B)\xc2\xa0in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by a Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. \n\n(ii) Payments by the Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n26 \n\n\n\nA notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b)\xc2\xa0shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. \n\n(c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to any Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to such Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. \n\n(d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section\xc2\xa011.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under Section\xc2\xa011.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section\xc2\xa011.04(c). \n\n(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. \n\n2.11 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a)\xc2\xa0notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b)\xc2\xa0purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that: \n\n(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and \n\n(ii) the provisions of this Section\xc2\xa0shall not be construed to apply to (x)\xc2\xa0any payment made by or on behalf of any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y)\xc2\xa0any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Company or any other Borrower or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing (as to which the provisions of this Section\xc2\xa0shall apply). \n\nEach Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n27 \n\n\n\n2.12 Extension of Maturity Date. \n\n(a) Requests for Extension. The Borrowers may (but only on three separate occasions during the term of this Agreement), by notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders), request that each Lender extend such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Maturity Date for an additional 364 days from the Maturity Date then in effect hereunder (the \xe2\x80\x9cExisting Maturity Date\xe2\x80\x9d). \n\n(b) Lender Elections to Extend. Each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent not later than the date (the \xe2\x80\x9cNotice Date\xe2\x80\x9d) that is 15 days subsequent to the date the Borrowers request an extension of the Maturity Date, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension (and each Lender that determines not to so extend its Maturity Date (a \xe2\x80\x9cNon-Extending Lender\xe2\x80\x9d)) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date) and any Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree. \n\n(c) Notification by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers of each Lender\xe2\x80\x99s determination under this Section no later than the date 15 days after the Notice Date. \n\n(d) Additional Commitment Lenders. The Company shall have the right to replace each Non-Extending Lender with, and add as \xe2\x80\x9cLenders\xe2\x80\x9d under this Agreement in place thereof, one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an \xe2\x80\x9cAdditional Commitment Lender\xe2\x80\x9d) as provided in Section\xc2\xa011.13; provided that each of such Additional Commitment Lenders shall enter into an Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Lender shall, effective as of the Existing Maturity Date, undertake a Commitment (and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s Commitment hereunder on such date). \n\n(e) Extension of Existing Maturity Date. If there are no Non-Extending Lenders or all of the Non-Extending Lenders are replaced by Additional Commitment Lenders as set forth in clause (d)\xc2\xa0of this Section, effective as of the Existing Maturity Date, the Maturity Date of each Lender that has agreed to so extend its Maturity Date and of each Additional Commitment Lender shall be extended to the date falling 364 days after the Existing Maturity Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Maturity Date as so extended shall be the immediately preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender shall thereupon become a \xe2\x80\x9cLender\xe2\x80\x9d for all purposes of this Agreement. If there are any Non-Extending Lenders that are not replaced in accordance with clause (d)\xc2\xa0above, the Borrowers may (x)\xc2\xa0withdraw their request for an extension and the Existing Maturity Date will remain in effect or (y)\xc2\xa0on the Existing Maturity Date, pay any such Non-Extending Lender in full for all principal, interest and other amounts owing to such Non-Extending Lender under this Agreement, reduce the Aggregate Commitments of the Lenders by the amount of the Commitments of such Non-Extending Lenders, and extend the Maturity Date to the date falling 364 days after the Existing Maturity Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Maturity Date as so extended shall be the immediately preceding Business Day). \n\n(f) Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions. As a condition precedent to such extension, each Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate (together with resolutions adopted by such Borrower approving or otherwise consenting to such extension) on or prior to the Existing Maturity Date signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower certifying that, before and after giving effect to such extension, (i)\xc2\xa0the representations and warranties contained in Article V (and, in the case of a Designated Borrower, in its Designated Borrower Request and Assumption Agreement) are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent that such representations and warranties are already qualified \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n28 \n\n\n\nby materiality, in which case they shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of such date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent that such representations and warranties are already qualified by materiality, in which case they shall be true and correct in all respects) as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a)\xc2\xa0and (b)\xc2\xa0of Section\xc2\xa05.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements delivered (or otherwise made available) pursuant to subsections (a)\xc2\xa0and (b), respectively, of Section\xc2\xa06.01, and (ii)\xc2\xa0no Default exists. In addition, on the Maturity Date of each Non-Extending Lender, the Borrowers shall prepay any Loans outstanding on such date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section\xc2\xa03.05) to the extent necessary to keep outstanding Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages of the respective Lenders effective as of such date. \n\n(g) Conflicting Provisions. This Section\xc2\xa0shall supersede any provisions in Section\xc2\xa02.11 or 11.01 to the contrary. \n\n2.13 Defaulting Lenders. \n\n(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: \n\n(i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender\xe2\x80\x99s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cRequired Lenders\xe2\x80\x9d and Section\xc2\xa011.01. \n\n(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article\xc2\xa0VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section\xc2\xa011.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Company may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Company, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender\xe2\x80\x99s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender\xe2\x80\x99s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Company as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender\xe2\x80\x99s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x)\xc2\xa0such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y)\xc2\xa0such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section\xc2\xa04.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n29 \n\n\n\n(iii) Certain Fees. No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section\xc2\xa02.07(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Company shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). \n\n(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Company and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Company while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided further that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender\xe2\x80\x99s having been a Defaulting Lender. \n\n2.14 Designated Borrowers. \n\n(a) The Company may at any time, upon not less than 10 Business Days\xe2\x80\x99 notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), designate any additional Subsidiary of the Company (an \xe2\x80\x9cApplicant Borrower\xe2\x80\x9d) as a Designated Borrower, subject to the approval of each of the Lenders, to receive Loans hereunder by delivering to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver counterparts thereof to each Lender) a duly executed notice and agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit E-1 (a \xe2\x80\x9cDesignated Borrower Request and Assumption Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that prior to any Applicant Borrower becoming entitled to utilize the credit facilities provided for herein the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received (i)\xc2\xa0such supporting resolutions, incumbency certificates and opinions of counsel, (ii)\xc2\xa0at least 5 Business Days prior to the effective date for such Applicant Borrower becoming a Designated Borrower hereunder, if reasonably requested by a Lender, other information and documentation (all such information and documentation, the \xe2\x80\x9cRegulatory Information\xe2\x80\x9d) that is required with respect to this Agreement by regulatory authorities under applicable \xe2\x80\x9cKnow Your Customer\xe2\x80\x9d and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including OFAC and the PATRIOT Act, in each case of (i)\xc2\xa0and (ii) above, in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as may be required by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders in their sole discretion, and (iii)\xc2\xa0Notes signed by such new Borrowers to the extent any Lenders so require. If the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders agree that an Applicant Borrower shall be entitled to receive Loans hereunder, then promptly following receipt of all such requested resolutions, incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel and Regulatory Information, the Administrative Agent shall send a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit E-2 (a \xe2\x80\x9cDesignated Borrower Notice\xe2\x80\x9d) to the Company and the Lenders specifying the effective date upon which the Applicant Borrower shall constitute a Designated Borrower for purposes hereof, whereupon each of the Lenders agrees to permit such Designated Borrower to receive Loans hereunder, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, and each of the parties agrees that such Designated Borrower otherwise shall be a Borrower for all purposes of this Agreement. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n30 \n\n\n\n(b) The Obligations of each Designated Borrower shall be guaranteed by the Company pursuant to the Guaranty contained in Article X. Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document and without in any way limiting the obligations of the Company in Article X or otherwise, (i)\xc2\xa0no Designated Borrower shall be obligated with respect to any Obligations of the Company or of any other Designated Borrower, (ii)\xc2\xa0the Obligations owed by a Designated Borrower shall be several and not joint with the Obligations of the Company or of any other Designated Borrower and (iii)\xc2\xa0no Designated Borrower shall be obligated as a guarantor under Article X with respect to the Guarantee Obligations. \n\n(c) Each Subsidiary of the Company that is or becomes a \xe2\x80\x9cDesignated Borrower\xe2\x80\x9d pursuant to this Section hereby irrevocably appoints the Company as its agent for purposes of (i)\xc2\xa0the giving and receipt of notices and (ii)\xc2\xa0the receipt of the proceeds of any Loans made by the Lenders to any such Designated Borrower hereunder. Any notice, demand, consent, acknowledgement, direction, certification or other communication delivered to the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been delivered to each Designated Borrower. \n\n(d) The Company may from time to time, upon not less than three (3)\xc2\xa0Business Days\xe2\x80\x99 notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), terminate a Designated Borrower\xe2\x80\x99s status as such; provided that there are no outstanding Loans payable by such Designated Borrower, or other amounts payable by such Designated Borrower on account of any Loans made to it, as of the effective date of such termination. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such termination of a Designated Borrower\xe2\x80\x99s status. \n\nARTICLE III. \n\nTAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY \n\n3.01 Taxes. \n\n(a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. (i)\xc2\xa0Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Administrative Agent or a Loan Party, then the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e)\xc2\xa0below. \n\n(i) If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A)\xc2\xa0the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e)\xc2\xa0below, (B)\xc2\xa0the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C)\xc2\xa0to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n31 \n\n\n\n(ii) If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A)\xc2\xa0such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e)\xc2\xa0below, (B)\xc2\xa0such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C)\xc2\xa0to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. \n\n(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties. Without limiting the provisions of subsection\xc2\xa0(a) above, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. \n\n(c) Tax Indemnifications. (i)\xc2\xa0Without duplication of amounts paid in Section\xc2\xa03.01(a), each of the Loan Parties shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; provided, that the Loan Parties shall not be obligated to make payment to any Recipient pursuant to this Section\xc2\xa03.01(c) in respect of penalties, interest and other liabilities attributable to any Indemnified Taxes if (x)\xc2\xa0written demand therefor has not been made by such Recipient within 60 days from the date on which such Recipient received written notice of the imposition of Indemnified Taxes by the relevant Governmental Authority, but only to the extent such penalties, interest and other similar liabilities are attributable to such failure or delay by the Recipient in making such written demand, (y)\xc2\xa0such penalties, interest and other liabilities have accrued after the relevant Loan Party had indemnified or paid an additional amount due as of the date of such payment pursuant to this Section\xc2\xa03.01 or (z)\xc2\xa0such penalties, interest and other liabilities are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any of the Recipients or their Affiliates. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender receives a written notice of Tax assessment from any Governmental Authority regarding any Tax in respect of which indemnification may be required pursuant to this Section\xc2\xa03.01(c), the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall notify the Company within 120 days following the receipt of such notice that such notice has been received; provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or the Lender to provide such notice shall not relieve the Loan Parties of the obligation to make any indemnification payment under this Agreement, unless the delay is more than two years from the date of receipt of such notice, in which case the Company shall have no obligation to make any indemnification payment under this Agreement. Each of the Loan Parties shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section\xc2\xa03.01(c)(ii) below. \n\n(ii) Each Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, (w)\xc2\xa0the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Party to do so), (x)\xc2\xa0the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party, as \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n32 \n\n\n\napplicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with the provisions of Section\xc2\xa011.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, (y)\xc2\xa0the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party, as applicable, against any Taxes incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or the Loan Party by any Governmental Authority as a result of the failure by such Lender to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e)\xc2\xa0and (z)\xc2\xa0the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or a Loan Party in connection with any Loan Document, and any related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause\xc2\xa0(ii). \n\n(d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Company, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Company or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be (it being understood that any failure of the Administrative Agent to so notify shall not relieve the Loan Parties of their indemnification obligations hereunder). \n\n(e) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. (i)\xc2\xa0Each Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Laws or when reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or the taxing authorities of a jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation either (A)\xc2\xa0set forth in Section\xc2\xa03.01(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below or (B)\xc2\xa0required by applicable law other than the Code or the taxing authorities of the jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable law to comply with the requirements for exemption or reduction of withholding tax in that jurisdiction) shall not be required if in the Lender\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. \n\n(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Borrower is a U.S. Person, \n\nA. any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n33 \n\n\n\nCompany or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form\xc2\xa0W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax and Bank of America as Administrative Agent shall deliver, on or prior to the Closing Date and from time to time upon the reasonable request of the Company, a properly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-9; provided that, if Bank of America fails to provide such IRS Form W-9 upon request of the Company, the Company\xe2\x80\x99s sole remedy shall be to withhold to the extent required by the applicable Treasury Regulations; \n\nB. any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: \n\n1. in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x)\xc2\xa0with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \xe2\x80\x9cinterest\xe2\x80\x9d article of such tax treaty and (y)\xc2\xa0with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness profits\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cother income\xe2\x80\x9d article of such tax treaty; \n\n2. executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; \n\n3. in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section\xc2\xa0881(c) of the Code, (x)\xc2\xa0a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a \xe2\x80\x9cbank\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of Section\xc2\xa0881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a \xe2\x80\x9c10\xc2\xa0percent shareholder\xe2\x80\x9d of the Company within the meaning of Section\xc2\xa0881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled foreign corporation\xe2\x80\x9d described in Section\xc2\xa0881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a \xe2\x80\x9cU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate\xe2\x80\x9d) and (y)\xc2\xa0executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or \n\n4. to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by copies of IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-2 or Exhibit D-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; \n\nC. any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n34 \n\n\n\nrequest of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\nD. if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section\xc2\xa01471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section\xc2\xa01471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. \n\n(iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. \n\n(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by a Loan Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that each Loan Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person. \n\n(g) Contesting Indemnified Taxes. If any Loan Party determines in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any Indemnified Taxes for which additional amounts have been paid or are due under this Section\xc2\xa03.01, the Administrative Agent or Lender (as applicable) shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with such Loan Party in challenging such Indemnified Taxes, at the Loan Party\xe2\x80\x99s expense, if so requested by the Loan Party in writing; provided that nothing in this Section\xc2\xa03.01(g) shall obligate the Administrative Agent or any Lender to take any action that, in its reasonable judgment, would be materially disadvantageous to such Person. \n\n(h) Survival. Each party\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n35 \n\n\n\n3.02 Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, (i)\xc2\xa0any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii)\xc2\xa0if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x)\xc2\xa0the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender in the affected currency or currencies or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender in Dollars to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y)\xc2\xa0if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. \n\n3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. Subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the provisions of Section\xc2\xa03.08, if, in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (a) (i)\xc2\xa0the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, or (ii)\xc2\xa0adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan (in each case with respect to this clause (a), \xe2\x80\x9cImpacted Loans\xe2\x80\x9d), or (b)\xc2\xa0the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders reasonably determine that for any reason the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company, each other Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x)\xc2\xa0the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y)\xc2\xa0in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company and each other Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n36 \n\n\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, but subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the provisions of Section\xc2\xa03.08, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in this Section, the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers and the Required Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1)\xc2\xa0the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a)\xc2\xa0of the first sentence of this Section, (2)\xc2\xa0the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3)\xc2\xa0any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Company written notice thereof. \n\n3.04 Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans. \n\n(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: \n\n(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except\xc2\xa0any reserve requirement contemplated by Section\xc2\xa03.04(e), other than as set forth below); or \n\n(ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender; \n\nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. This Section\xc2\xa03.04 shall not apply to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by Section\xc2\xa03.01. \n\n(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s capital or on the capital of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s policies and the policies of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s holding company for any such reduction suffered. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n37 \n\n\n\n(c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a)\xc2\xa0or (b)\xc2\xa0of this Section\xc2\xa0and delivered to the Company shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such Lender shall also certify that it is generally charging such costs to similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender under agreements having provisions similar to this Section\xc2\xa03.04 after consideration of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant (which determination shall be made in good faith). The Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. \n\n(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s right to demand such compensation, provided that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section\xc2\xa0for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 120 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 120-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). \n\n(e) Additional Reserve Requirements. The Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive). Such Lender shall deliver a certificate to the Borrower setting forth in reasonable detail a calculation of such actual costs incurred by such Lender and shall certify that it is generally charging such costs to similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender under agreements having provisions similar to this Section\xc2\xa03.04 after consideration of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant (which determination shall be made in good faith). The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan. If a Lender fails to give notice 30 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable 30 days from receipt of such notice. \n\n3.05 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to promptly compensate) such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss (other than lost profit), cost or expense incurred by it (other than by reason of such Lender being a Defaulting Lender) as a result of: \n\n(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); \n\n(b) any failure by any Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower; \n\n(c) any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or \n\n(d) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section\xc2\xa011.13; \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n38 \n\n\n\nincluding any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. \n\nFor purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company (or the applicable Designated Borrower) to the Lenders under this Section, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded. \n\n3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. \n\n(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. Each Lender may make any Loan to a Borrower through any Lending Office; provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of such Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under Section\xc2\xa03.04, or requires any Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section\xc2\xa03.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section\xc2\xa03.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i)\xc2\xa0would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section\xc2\xa03.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section\xc2\xa03.02, as applicable, and (ii)\xc2\xa0in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. \n\n(b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section\xc2\xa03.04, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section\xc2\xa03.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different Lending Office in accordance with Section\xc2\xa03.06(a), the Company may replace such Lender in accordance with Section\xc2\xa011.13. \n\n3.07 Survival.

Thereafter, (i)\xc2\xa0the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (ii)\xc2\xa0the Eurocurrency Rate component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Base Rate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (subject to the foregoing clause (ii)) in the amount specified therein. \n\nNotwithstanding anything else herein, if any LIBOR Successor Rate shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of this Agreement. \n\nARTICLE IV. \n\nCONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO BORROWINGS \n\n4.01 Conditions of Initial Loan.

Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and neither the Company nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cagent\xe2\x80\x9d herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. \n\n9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term \xe2\x80\x9cLender\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cLenders\xe2\x80\x9d shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with any Borrower, any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. \n\n9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: \n\n(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n52 \n\n\n\n(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and \n\n(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. \n\nThe Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i)\xc2\xa0with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections\xc2\xa010.01 and 8.02) or (ii)\xc2\xa0in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a Lender. \n\nThe Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i)\xc2\xa0any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii)\xc2\xa0the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii)\xc2\xa0the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv)\xc2\xa0the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v)\xc2\xa0the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. \n\n9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. \n\n9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n53 \n\n\n\nParties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. \n\n9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. \n\n(a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the written consent of the Company, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the \xe2\x80\x9cResignation Effective Date\xe2\x80\x9d), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders, appoint, with the written consent of the Company, a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. \n\n(b) If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d)\xc2\xa0of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with the written consent of the Company, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the \xe2\x80\x9cRemoval Effective Date\xe2\x80\x9d), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. \n\n(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1)\xc2\xa0the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2)\xc2\xa0except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor\xe2\x80\x99s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section\xc2\xa03.01(g) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agent\xe2\x80\x99s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section\xc2\xa011.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n54 \n\n\n\n9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. \n\n9.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers or other agency or arranger titles listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder. \n\n9.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: \n\n(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections\xc2\xa02.07 and 11.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and \n\n(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; \n\nand any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections\xc2\xa02.07 and 11.04. \n\nNothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n55 \n\n\n\nARTICLE X. \n\nCOMPANY GUARANTY \n\n10.01 Continuing Guaranty. The Company hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all of the Obligations, whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, of the Designated Borrowers to the Credit Parties, arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees and expenses incurred by the Credit Parties in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof, the \xe2\x80\x9cGuarantee Obligations\xe2\x80\x9d). The Administrative Agent\xe2\x80\x99s books and records showing the amount of the Guarantee Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon the Company, and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guarantee Obligations absent manifest error. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guarantee Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guarantee Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guarantee Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Company under this Guaranty (other than full payment and performance), and the Company hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing. \n\n10.02 Rights of Credit Parties. The Company consents and agrees that the Credit Parties may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a)\xc2\xa0amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guarantee Obligations or any part thereof; (b)\xc2\xa0take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guarantee Obligations; (c)\xc2\xa0apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in their sole discretion may determine; and (d)\xc2\xa0release one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guarantee Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Company under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of the Company under this Guaranty. \n\n10.03 Certain Waivers. The Company waives (a)\xc2\xa0any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Designated Borrower or any other guarantors, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Credit Party) of the liability of any Designated Borrower; (b)\xc2\xa0any defense based on any claim that the Company\xe2\x80\x99s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any Designated Borrower; (c)\xc2\xa0any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Credit Party; (d)\xc2\xa0any defense arising from any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or any other event affecting any term of an obligation of the Company; and (e)\xc2\xa0to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable Law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties (other than full payment and performance). The Company expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guarantee Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Guarantee Obligations. As provided below, this Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York. \n\n10.04 Obligations Independent. The obligations of the Company hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guarantee Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against the Company to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any Designated Borrower or any other Person is joined as a party. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n56 \n\n\n\n10.05 Subrogation. The Company shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty have been paid and performed in full (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case, for which no claim has been made) and the Commitments are terminated. If any amounts are paid to the Company in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Credit Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Credit Parties to reduce the amount of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. \n\n10.06 Termination; Reinstatement. This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Guarantee Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are paid in full in cash (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case, for which no claim has been made) and the Commitments are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of any Designated Borrower or the Company is made, or any of the Credit Parties exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Credit Parties in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Credit Parties are in possession of or have released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.

Upon request, each Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d)\xc2\xa0of this Section. \n\n(c) Register.

Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or the Company, any Borrower or any such Person\xe2\x80\x99s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a \xe2\x80\x9cParticipant\xe2\x80\x9d) in all or a portion of such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i)\xc2\xa0such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii)\xc2\xa0such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii)\xc2\xa0the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender\xe2\x80\x99s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section\xc2\xa011.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation. \n\nAny agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section\xc2\xa011.01 that affects such Participant. The Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections\xc2\xa03.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b)\xc2\xa0of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under Section\xc2\xa03.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b)\xc2\xa0of this Section; provided that such Participant (A)\xc2\xa0agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections\xc2\xa03.06 and 11.13 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b)\xc2\xa0of this Section and (B)\xc2\xa0shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections\xc2\xa03.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Company\xe2\x80\x99s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company to effectuate the provisions of Section\xc2\xa03.06 with respect to any Participant. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting as a non-fiduciary agent, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the \xe2\x80\x9cParticipant Register\xe2\x80\x9d); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n65 \n\n\n\nidentity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant\xe2\x80\x99s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section\xc2\xa05f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. \n\n(e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. \n\n11.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Subject to the last sentence of this Section, each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a)\xc2\xa0to those of its Affiliates and Related Parties who the Administrative Agent or any such Lender reasonably determines needs to know such Information (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential in accordance with the provisions of this Section), (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority that has or claims to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d)\xc2\xa0to any other party hereto, (e)\xc2\xa0in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f)\xc2\xa0subject to an agreement containing provisions substantively the same as (or more restrictive than) those of this Section, to any assignee of or any prospective assignee of, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, (g)\xc2\xa0with the consent of the Company or (h)\xc2\xa0to the extent such Information becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section. For purposes of this Section, \xe2\x80\x9cInformation\xe2\x80\x9d means all information received from the Company or any Subsidiary relating to the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company or any Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (x)\xc2\xa0nothing contained in this Section shall supersede any nondisclosure or confidentiality provision contained in any nondisclosure agreement, confidentiality agreement or other similar agreement (any such agreement, a \xe2\x80\x9cNondisclosure Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d) entered into between the Company or any of its affiliates and any Lead Arranger, Lender or any of their respective affiliates to the extent otherwise applicable to any Information; it being understood and agreed that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Section and the nondisclosure or confidentiality provisions contained in any Nondisclosure Agreement as it relates to any Information, the nondisclosure or confidentiality provision contained in such Nondisclosure Agreement shall govern; and (y)\xc2\xa0whether or not any Loan Document constitutes Information, the Loan Documents can be shared on a confidential basis with (i)\xc2\xa0any Participant or prospective Participant hereunder, (ii)\xc2\xa0any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to any Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (iii)\xc2\xa0any rating agency in connection with rating the Company or its Subsidiaries or the credit facility provided hereunder or (iv)\xc2\xa0the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit facility provided hereunder. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n66 \n\n\n\n11.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency, but excluding deposits in (i)\xc2\xa0trust or other fiduciary accounts (to the extent of amounts held therein in trust in the ordinary course of business on behalf of third parties who are not Loan Parties), (ii)\xc2\xa0payroll accounts, (iii)\xc2\xa0health-savings accounts and worker\xe2\x80\x99s compensation accounts, (iv)\xc2\xa0withholding tax accounts and (v)\xc2\xa0zero balance accounts used in the ordinary course of business) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Company or any other Loan Party against any and all of the obligations of the Company or such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such obligations of the Company or such Loan Party are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x)\xc2\xa0all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section\xc2\xa02.13 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y)\xc2\xa0the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. \n\n11.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the \xe2\x80\x9cMaximum Rate\xe2\x80\x9d). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Company. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a)\xc2\xa0characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b)\xc2\xa0exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c)\xc2\xa0amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. \n\n11.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section\xc2\xa04.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging means (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cpdf\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctif\xe2\x80\x9d) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n67 \n\n\n\n11.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied. \n\n11.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a)\xc2\xa0the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b)\xc2\xa0the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. \n\n11.13 Replacement of Lenders. If the Company is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section\xc2\xa03.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section\xc2\xa011.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections\xc2\xa03.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: \n\n(a) the Company shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section\xc2\xa011.06(b); \n\n(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section\xc2\xa03.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or applicable Designated Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); \n\n(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section\xc2\xa03.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section\xc2\xa03.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; \n\n(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and \n\n(e) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. \n\nA Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n68 \n\n\n\n11.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. \n\n(a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN) AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. \n\n(b) SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.

In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Company and each other Loan Party acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 understanding, that: (i) (A)\xc2\xa0the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders are arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length commercial transactions between the Company, each other Loan Party and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B)\xc2\xa0each of the Company and the other Loan Parties has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C)\xc2\xa0each of the Company and the other Loan Parties is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A)\xc2\xa0each of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and each Lender is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Company, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or any other Person and (B)\xc2\xa0neither the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers nor any Lender has any obligation to the Company, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii)\xc2\xa0the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company, the other Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates, and none of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers nor any Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Company, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Company and each other Loan Party hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any Lender with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby. \n\n11.17 Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents. The words \xe2\x80\x9cexecute,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexecution,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csigned,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csignature,\xe2\x80\x9d and words of like import in or related to any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without limitation Assignment and Assumptions, amendments or other modifications, Loan Notices, waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations on electronic platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it. \n\n11.18 USA PATRIOT Act.
